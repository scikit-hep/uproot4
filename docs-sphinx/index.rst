|br| Uproot is a library for reading (and soon, writing) ROOT files in pure Python and NumPy.

How to install
==============

Usually, you'll want to install Uproot with `Awkward Array <https://awkward-array.org>`__ because this is the default array format.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install uproot awkward

But if you are working in a limited environment, Uproot can be installed without Awkward Array.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install uproot

Just be sure to pass ``library="np"`` to any function that returns arrays or globally set ``uproot.default_library`` to specify that you want NumPy arrays, rather than Awkward Arrays. Alternatively, you can specify ``library="pd"`` for `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`__, which, like Awkward Array, would need to be explicitly installed.

Documentation
=============

**ROOT** is a C++ toolkit for data analysis, part of which is the ROOT file format. Over an exabyte of particle physics data are stored in ROOT files around the world.

**Uproot** is a Python implementation of ROOT I/O, independent of the ROOT toolkit itself (including ROOT's Python interface, PyROOT).

- If you need help understanding ROOT and its ecosystem, see the `ROOT project documentation <https://root.cern/get_started/>`__.
- If you know what a ROOT file is but are unfamiliar with Uproot, see the :doc:`basic`.
- If you are migrating from an older version to Uproot 4, see the :doc:`uproot3-to-4`.
- If you need detailed descriptions of a class's properties or a function's parameters, see the left-bar on this site (≡ button on mobile) or use ``help`` in Python, ``?`` or shift-tab in iPython/Jupyter.

Getting help
============

- Report bugs, request features, and ask for additional documentation on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot4/issues>`__.
- If you have a "How do I...?" question, start a `GitHub Discussion <https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot4/discussions>`__ with category "Q&A".
- Alternatively, ask about it on `StackOverflow with the [uproot] tag <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/uproot>`__. Be sure to include tags for any other libraries that you use, such as Pandas or PyTorch.
- To ask questions in real time, try the Gitter `Scikit-HEP/uproot <https://gitter.im/Scikit-HEP/uproot>`__ chat room.
